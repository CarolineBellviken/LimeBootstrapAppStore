#LIME Garcon
##Serving you the numbers you care about
###All instructions can be found in the document "LIME Garcon.docx"  
The LIME Garcon presents the result from filters that you setup in LIME. A filter could for instance be “history notes made on my customers by anyone else but myself during last day” and present a “# new history notes” on your actionpad. 
Each item can use individual color settings making it easy to identify urgency.
When you click on the text, LIME will bring you to the correct table with the appropriate filter.
As you set your filters yourself, only you, LIME and the sky is the limit.
